# School Management System API

This project is a backend API for a school management system, built with Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.  
It provides RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on teachers (representing the school), classes (standards), and students.

---

## Features

- **Teacher Management:** Create and retrieve teacher information (the default teacher is "Viswabharathi High School").
- **Class Management:** Create and manage classes (standards) for the school.
- **Student Management:** Add and view student records, assigning them to specific classes.
- **RESTful API:** A clean, well-structured API for easy integration with a front-end application.
- **Automatic Documentation:** Interactive API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI (via Swagger UI).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python
- **API Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic
- **Server:** Uvicorn

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL server running

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. See below.)*

4.  **Set up the database:**
    - Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    - Create a new database named `school_db`.
    - Update the database connection string in `app/database.py` if your credentials are different.

5.  **Run the database seeder script:**
    This will create the tables and populate them with initial data.
    ```bash
    python seed_data.py
    ```

6.  **Start the API server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

The API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive Swagger UI documentation in your browser at:

[**http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs**](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

From this page, you can view all available endpoints and test them directly.

## Note

- This project is designed for a single school ("Viswabharathi High School"), represented by the Teacher model.
- All standards and students are associated with this school via the teacher.
